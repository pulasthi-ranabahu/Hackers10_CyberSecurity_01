# 🔐 Web Application Penetration Testing Report - Hackers10 Internship

This repository contains the penetration testing report and supporting documentation created as part of my **Cyber Security Internship at Hackers10 Pvt Ltd**, conducted from **April 8, 2025 to May 8, 2025**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to evaluate the security posture of a vulnerable web application (`http://testphp.vulnweb.com`) using real-world penetration testing techniques and methodologies. This hands-on engagement simulated a professional web application assessment, with a focus on identifying critical vulnerabilities and recommending remediation strategies.

## 📅 Duration
**Start Date:** April 8, 2025  
**End Date:** May 8, 2025

## 🧪 Methodology

The assessment followed a structured penetration testing lifecycle:

1. **Planning**  
   - Defined scope, rules of engagement, and objectives based on internship guidelines.

2. **Discovery**  
   - Performed reconnaissance using tools like `nmap`, `nikto`, and `dirb`  
   - Identified open ports, services, and hidden directories.

3. **Attack / Exploitation**  
   - Tested for **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and **Network Interception**  
   - Simulated real-world attacks to evaluate application defenses.

4. **Reporting**  
   - Documented all vulnerabilities, exploitation attempts, and provided risk analysis and mitigation suggestions.
